Simple Discord Bot made in Java. 

This bot had been developed with JDA 5.0.

It has some Music Commands such as:
/Play <url> --> Play any track. It automatically add it to a queue if there're already any track being played
/Skip --> Skip to the next track
/Disconnect --> Disconnect bot from any VC
/Pause --> Pause the current track
/Resume --> Continue the current track
/Clear --> Clear the tracks on queue
/volume <Int Value> --> Set the volume of the audioplayer. Value from 0-10
/queue --> Shows the tracks in queue
I'll add some other commands in future releases. Commands such as: OnTrackInfo (tittle, duration etc) and some other useful commands!

`--HOW TO SETUP--`
1. Download the .jar from releases 
2. Make a config.properties file on the same folder that you have the .jar -> Be sure the file is named exactly config.properties 
3. Inside config.properties just add discord_api_key=INSERT_YOUR_API_KEY 
4. Just doble click on the jar once u added your api key and there you go!

`--REQUERIMENTS--`
-Have installed JDA 19.0 and added into your enviroment variables.
